    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>Predicting the stock markets movements are of great interests for hedge fund, quants fund and also investors.
      
      
      As presented in "random walk theory," it is difficult to predict the precise price movement with a huge amount of noises.
      This project will use Neural Networks to predict such a price movement.
      
      
      
      
      We solely focus on the technical analysis (analysis on the past markets data) in this project rather than fundamental analysis (analysis on company's data as of now).
      
      Investing in stock markets takes a lot in consideration, such as tax, trading costs, and risk management generally. 
      With this nature, it is difficult to consider how much we can benefit from a single transaction without finance knowledge.
      This project aims to
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>predict up/down for the equity, not considering how much they would change at the first place, and</li>
      <li>focus on a specific industry, or even for a few companies in the industry since it is generally difficult to build a universal model for all stock markets prediction.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This project will utilize the datasets from actual markets, such as JPX.
