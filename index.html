    <h1>Stock Markets Movement Prediction and Equity Price Relationships with Neural Network (or Graph Neural Network)</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Predicting the stock markets movements are of great interests for hedge fund, quants fund and also investors. Financial Securities firms try to 
      develop the algorithm that automatically trades with information from news articles, data, and markets trends. Some hedge/quants fund experience increase
      of their markets, and computational analysis are developing rapidly.
      (Note that, it is nearly impossible to deal with outliers with algorithm or neural networks, known as "Black Swan" markets theory. 
      Also as presented in "random walk theory," it is impossible to predict the precise price movement with a huge amount of noises. ) 
      
      <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>We solely focus on the technical analysis (analysis on the past markets data) in this project, and aim to predict
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>up/down for the equity and possibly how much</li>
      <li>fluctuations of stock markets</li>
      <li>directions/trends of stock markets</li>
      <li>possibly day-to-day trend for more practical use in the context of making decisions for investments in the longer span</li>
      <li>(For graph neural network) visualize the relationships between each stock</li>
      
    </ol>
    
    <p>This project will utilize the Public Datasets (PDS) from actual markets, such as JPX (link: https://quote.jpx.co.jp/jpx/template/quote.cgi?F=tmp/e_stock_search),
      build a model for prediciton, and see how accurately our model can predict the price at the end. I also expect to focus on a specific industry, 
      or even for a few companies in the industry since it is generally difficult to build a universal model for all stock markets prediction all at once.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Predict the possible stock movement and its effect onto the other stocks in the industry</li>
      <li>Train a Neural-Network model for the prediction</li>
      <li>Apply it to a real-world datasets</li>
      <li>Utilize this model for making decisions for investments on stock markets</li>
      <li>Possibly identify the relationships across the different stocks in the same industry (with graph neural network)</li>
      <li>Try investing on a website to see how much we would earn using this model</li>
    </ol>
