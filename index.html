    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>Investing in stock markets takes a lot in consideration, such as tax, trading costs, and risk management generally. 
      With this nature, it is difficult to consider how much we can benefit from a single transaction without finance knowledge.
      This project aims to
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>predict up/down for the equity, not considering how much they would change at the first place, and</li>
      <li>focus on a specific industry, or even for a few companies in the industry since it is generally difficult to build a universal model for all stock markets prediction.</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Predict the possible stock movement and its effect onto the other stocks in the industry</li>
      <li></li>
    </ol>
